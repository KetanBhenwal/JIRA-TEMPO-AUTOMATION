## Log File Structure

All logs are written to both console output and the log file specified in `AI_AGENT_CONFIG.logFile` with the following format:

```
[2025-09-11T10:30:45.123Z] 🚀 Starting AI Time Tracking Agent...
[2025-09-11T10:30:45.456Z] 🔧 Configuration: Monitor every 5min, Work session min 15min, Auto-log after 1h
[2025-09-11T10:30:46.789Z] 🔄 Loading agent data from file...
[2025-09-11T10:30:47.012Z] ✅ Loaded 25 previous sessions, 18 logged sessions, 150 keyword mappings
```

This comprehensive logging system provides complete visibility into the AI agent's operations, making it easier to troubleshoot issues, monitor performance, and understand user behavior patterns.

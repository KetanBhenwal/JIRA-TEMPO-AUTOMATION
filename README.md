## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- JIRA account with API token
- Tempo account with API token

## Setup (macOS / Linux Quick Start)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   If you pulled an updated version of the repository that added new scripts (e.g. cross‑platform init launcher), run `npm install` again to ensure `cross-env` and any new dev dependencies are installed.

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file with the following content:
     - `JIRA_BASE_URL` (e.g., https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/)
     - `TEMPO_BASE_URL` (should be https://api.tempo.io/4)
     - `JIRA_EMAIL` (your Atlassian email)
     - `JIRA_API_TOKEN` (from https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
     - `TEMPO_API_TOKEN` (from Tempo settings)
     - `TEMPO_ACCOUNT_ID` (your Atlassian account ID)
     - `PORT` (optional, defaults to 3000)

3. **Start the application (interactive menu, cross‑platform):**

   **Recommended (Node launcher – works on Windows/macOS/Linux)**
   ```sh
   npm run setup
   ```
   (Falls back to legacy shell script on macOS/Linux if you prefer: `./start-ai-agent.sh`)

   **Option 2: Web Server + Manual AI Control**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   Then navigate to the AI Agent dashboard to start/stop the agent.

   **Option 3: AI Agent Only (Background)**
   ```sh
   npm run ai-agent
   ```

   **Option 4: Fast Test Mode (auto intervals + dry run)**
   ```sh
   npm run agent:test
   ```

4. **Access the interfaces:**
   - **Main Time Logger:** `http://localhost:3000`
   - **AI Agent Dashboard:** `http://localhost:3000/ai-agent.html`

## Windows Users 🪟

You now have native scripts:

| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Interactive menu | `npm run setup` or double‑click `start-ai-agent.bat` |
| PowerShell advanced | `./start-ai-agent.ps1 -Test -DryRun` |
| Start agent (prod) | `npm run agent:prod` |
| Start test mode | `npm run agent:test` |
| Status | `npm run ai-status` |

Notes:
1. Browser URL + active window detection is currently macOS‑optimized. Windows implementation provides foreground window title and process via PowerShell (sufficient for issue key detection in editors/terminals). Browser URL introspection for Edge/Chrome is a future enhancement (would require enabling remote debugging protocol).
2. Meeting detection still works using window title / process name heuristics (Teams/Zoom). If you run into edge cases, set `AI_AGENT_VERBOSE_LOG=true` to collect a sample and open an issue.
3. All paths use `path` module so backslashes are handled automatically.

## Scaling & Performance ⚙️

Recent improvements (this version):
* Concurrency & rate‑limited child process execution (`limitedExec`) prevents spawn storms.
* Cached activity type classification (5s window) reduces repeated regex scans for each API request.
* Optional verbose logging (`AI_AGENT_VERBOSE_LOG=true`) to cut I/O overhead in normal mode.
* Windows + Linux fallbacks for active app & window enumeration (best effort where OS APIs differ).
* Reduced synchronous shell usage (removed `pwd`, consolidated enumeration logic).

Environment knobs (override in `.env` or runtime config endpoints):
| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `AI_AGENT_TEST_MODE` | Fast test intervals (see test config) |
| `AI_AGENT_DRY_RUN` | Prevents actual Tempo logging |
| `AI_AGENT_VERBOSE_LOG` | Force detailed logs (default off in prod) |
| `AI_AGENT_RUNNING_APPS_REFRESH_MS` | Override refresh cadence for running app enumeration |
| `AI_AGENT_MEETING_SCORE_THRESHOLD` | Tune meeting classification threshold (default 7) |
| `AI_AGENT_LEGACY_MEETING_DETECTION` | Force legacy simpler meeting detection |

Runtime adjustments (no restart): PATCH `/api/ai-agent/runtime-config` with fields like `monitoringInterval`, `workSessionThreshold`, etc. (values in ms or minutes auto‑converted if <1000).

Optimization tips:
1. Increase `monitoringInterval` if machine is resource constrained (e.g., from 5m to 7m) – sampler still gives fine‑grained context.
2. If you experience high CPU from PowerShell enumeration on Windows, set `AI_AGENT_VERBOSE_LOG=false` and lengthen `AI_AGENT_RUNNING_APPS_REFRESH_MS` (e.g., 600000 for 10m).
3. Use dry run test mode before rolling changes to production accounts.

## Fresh Setup & Reset ♻️

On first run (`npm run setup`) the project will:
* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if missing.
* Remove any stale data/log files.
* Create a sentinel `.initialized` file.

To force a clean slate later:
```sh
npm run reset
```
This sets `AI_AGENT_RESET=true`, deletes agent data/logs, and preserves your `.env`.

Manual one-off initialization (non-interactive):
```sh
npm run init
```

If you need to regenerate `.env`, delete it and re-run `npm run init` (your credentials will need to be re-entered).

## 🤖 AI Agent Usage

### Quick Start
1. Run `./start-ai-agent.sh` and choose option 1
2. Open the AI Agent dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/ai-agent.html`
3. Click "Start Agent" to begin monitoring
4. Work on your JIRA issues as usual
5. Review and approve detected sessions in the dashboard

### How the AI Agent Works

1. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitors your:
   - Active applications (VS Code, Terminal, browsers, etc.)
   - Window titles (looking for JIRA keys and project names)
   - Git branches and repositories
   - Work hours (9 AM - 6 PM on weekdays)

2. **Detection**: Uses multiple strategies to identify work sessions:
   - JIRA key patterns in window titles (e.g., "PROJ-123")
   - Development tool usage (VS Code, Terminal, IDEs)
   - Git branch analysis
   - Keyword matching with assigned issues

3. **Auto-Logging**: 
   - **High confidence (≥70%)**: Automatically logs to Tempo
   - **Medium confidence (60-69%)**: Awaits your approval
   - **Low confidence (<60%)**: Ignored

4. **Review**: Use the web dashboard to:
   - View detected sessions
   - Approve/reject pending sessions
   - Correct issue assignments
   - Monitor auto-logged time

### AI Agent Commands

```sh
# Start the AI agent in background
npm run ai-agent

# Check agent status
npm run ai-status

# Interactive setup menu
./start-ai-agent.sh
```

## Manual Time Logging (Web Interface)

1. When you open the web interface, it will automatically fetch and display:
   - Your assigned JIRA issues
   - Issues where you were mentioned in comments but not assigned (under "Adhoc Tasks")
2. You can use the search boxes to filter issues by key, summary, or status
3. Click the "Log Time" button next to any issue to select it for time logging
4. Fill in the required details:
   - Time spent (in hours)
   - Work description
   - Date
   - Start Time (HH:MM:SS format)
   - Time Type (required custom field)
   - Task Type (required custom field)
   - Technology Time Type (required custom field)
5. Click "Submit Time Log" to record your work time
6. You'll see a success message with the worklog ID when the time is successfully logged

## Security

This application stores your JIRA and Tempo API tokens in the `.env` file, which should never be committed to version control.

## Note

Legacy command-line scripts have been moved to the `/unused` directory for reference. The web application is now the recommended way to log time.

1. **JIRA API Token Issues:**
   - Generate a new token at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
   - Update your .env file

2. **Tempo API Issues:**
   - Verify your Tempo API token in Tempo settings
   - Make sure your account has Tempo access

3. **Issue ID vs Key:**
   - Tempo API v4 requires numeric issue IDs, not issue keys
   - Use `tempo-logger-id.js` for most reliable results

## Security
- Do not commit your `.env` file to version control.
- Your API tokens and account IDs are sensitive information.
